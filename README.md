In the second semester, in the course Human and Computer Interaction (Laboratory Class), I have an assignment to create a website for the Jockey's Conference Centre (JCC) with requirements. In this repository, I've already attached the requirements, documentation,the figma link prototype, and a direct link to the website design that you can see directly.
